# Cloud-data-Engineering-Student-Health
# Student Mental Health Data Project (using Microsoft Azure)

This project analyzes student mental health trends using Azure-based cloud tools. It includes data ingestion, processing, and visualization.

## 🔧 Tools Used

- **Azure Blob Storage** – raw data storage
- **Azure Data Factory** – data pipeline creation
- **Power BI** – dashboard for mental health metrics
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)** – data cleaning & EDA

## 📁 Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for cleaning and exploration
- `script/`: Python scripts for Azure SDK usage
- `azure/`: diagrams or screenshot from platform
- `dashboard/`: Screenshots or PBIX file for Power BI

## 📊 Key Insights

- A significant proportion of students who reported experiencing anxiety or depression had not visited a mental health specialist, highlighting a potential gap in access to or awareness of available mental health support services.

- Additionally, students reporting frequent panic attacks often also indicated feelings of both anxiety and depression, suggesting strong comorbidity among these conditions. This underscores the importance of early intervention and accessible mental health resources on campuses.
